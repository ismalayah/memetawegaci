And on Wednesday, February 28, Survivor 46 will take center stage as the reality competition show’s newest addition.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>According to a report from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a>, season 46’s first and second episodes will each run for two hours — from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. ET/PT on the network. Then, Survivor 46 will drop to 90-minute weekly episodes until its finale, which will likely be another multi-hour special.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>The announcement that season 46 will also feature lengthened episodes is welcomed news by the Survivor community. Because of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and the production of scripted television going on a hiatus, Survivor 45 debuted with 90-minute episodes.</p><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>And after eight of them, it’s clear that the extra minutes have had a positive effect on the season.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>The half-hour increase affords more time spent with the players and the game’s social and strategic dynamics, and we dread the possible day of Survivor returning to its 60-minute time slot. Although Survivor 45 has been a ratings juggernaut for CBS, it is unclear if they’ll continue the 90-minute episodes next fall when scripted television is presumably back in full swing.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Considering we’re in the new era of Survivor, season 46’s game will likely last 26 days while 18 castaways compete for $1 million. The reality TV titan used to maroon castaways for 39 days, but in Survivor 41, the game shrunk to 26, and it doesn’t appear that that’ll change anytime soon.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>And like every iteration since season 33’s Millennials vs. Gen X, Survivor 46 was filmed in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiji’s Mamanuca Islands</a>. It was likely shot in June 2023 right after Survivor 45 wrapped, according to Parade.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Season 46’s cast hasn’t been announced yet, and the hopefuls’ names probably won’t be shared by CBS until 2024. But, since it’s a reality show, spoilers are always floating around the interwebs. We recently shared a rumored cast list that was posted to Reddit, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you can check that out by tapping or clicking here</a>.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Regardless, there are still several episodes remaining of Survivor 45.
