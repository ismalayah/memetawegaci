Also, the most recent star of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelorette</a>, the incomparable <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity Lawson</a> — who will be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taking her talents to Dancing With the Stars</a> with her new fiancé Dotun — will be stopping by.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Charity’s season just finished airing last week and some of her cast-offs could be causing chaos in Paradise. Not only do we have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince Charming Sean McLaughlin</a>, who annoyed everyone on the show and insulted scarf-wearers while he himself was wearing a scarf – but Peter Cappio will be there also.</p><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>Peter was the recipient of a not-so-inside-joke where contestants such as Sean would sign off with “FP” on their social media posts. It was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed during the Men Tell All</a> episode that “FP” stands for “Fu** Peter.” It’s highly unlikely that Peter, who only appeared on Charity’s season for the first night before getting booted and apparently leaving an ever-lasting impression on many of the guys, is going to be carrying any respect for so-called charmers like Sean.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Yet, the rivalry from Charity’s season that involves two men that nearly came to blows will be reunited in Prizefighters in Paradise. Brayden earned the envy of other men when Charity gave him her first impression rose. When the guys complained, it led to Charity and Brayden spending their time talking about the guy’s complaining and ultimately resulting in Brayden’s departure.</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>Upon his return to apologize to Charity and wish her well, Aaron physically got in Brayden’s way because he didn’t like that Brayden was back, albeit just to say goodbye. However, he blocked Brayden from leaving, which makes little sense, so they traded insults until Aaron told Brayden that he isn’t a man. Brayden finally was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ready for the confrontation to come to blows</a>, something he reiterated during the Men Tell All episode, but Aaron backed down, which was surprising since he started the whole confrontation.</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=211 data-injectable=false>Maybe Aaron would like to continue that confrontation now. Brayden seems as if he doesn’t care and is able to brush it off but if Aaron brings it, which is doubtful, then we’ll have a showdown in the sands.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Yet, bringing all these personalities together almost always results in some unforeseen fight on the show. So, who is it going to be this time? With half the men sporting magnificent egos, surely we won’t be denied another fairly unnecessary argument-turned-fisticuffs in a place oddly called Paradise, season 9 of which begins on Thursday Sep 28 on ABC.</p><p data-characters=95 data-current-count=95 data-injectable=false>It will be a two-hour premiere preceded by the one-hour series premiere of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Golden Bachelor</a>.</p><p data-characters=35 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>Don’t forget to pop your popcorn.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yosdNmqZ6ZlK56p7vRZphmqpmrrq2%2B2GapnqGXo7a1scNmmKxlkpawqbHLqKlmoZ5ivaK%2BwJ2grJ1dmK60wIyiqmaZnqO8trrCnpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
