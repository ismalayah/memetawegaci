Recommended Videos For those unaware, we recently reported on intel from The Cosmic Circus which claims Wilson’s Leila Taylor will be in the project. The character has been around in the comic pages for decades and was first created in 1971."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The character has been around in the comic pages for decades and was first created in 1971. In source material, she is a regular human reporter, dated Wilson, and is one of the first people to know his true identity when secrecy of this type was still a thing in superhero culture. She has also been an advocate of equality for Black Americans and others regardless of their skin color and, while often someone Wilson had to rescue and little more, later stories gave her depth and her own power as a good journalist.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a story</a> with Captain America and Wilson in his Falcon role from 2004, she works to expose drug smuggling in the United States. She and Wilson later get engaged, but this does not pan out and her latest appearances were tied to The Daily Bugle.</p><p data-characters=769 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>Now, as movies can change a lot between production and when they finally release, it is best to take the suggestion the character will be brought back from obscurity with a grain of salt, but, if it does happen, The Cosmic Circus speculates Xosha Roquemore will be taking on the role. She is the right age to be paired with Mackie, though other claims suggest the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Diamondback</a> will be given this prominence instead. In the comics, Rachel Leighton was a supervillain first before catching feelings for Steve Rogers. She later sided with him during Marvel’s Civil War and ultimately returned to being a villainous figure, but, in the cinematic universe things can certainly differ so we could also have this and possibly a love triangle of sorts on our hands, too.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>Whatever the case, here’s hoping for a tie-in to Spider-Man if Taylor ends up in the film. There has been little on the character since Spider-Man: No Way Home, and he has had some funny moments with Wilson in the past, so this could be a good cross-promotional opportunity, especially if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors about another film</a> with the character starting soon are even correct at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXZ7AbrjEoqOaZaSWxq270Wagp2Wdlr%2B3sctmop6xXZiuscDAoqVmmZ2av6qvwGalnq9drLyzuMNmpquclad6pLTAq5icrJWneqbEz6WYoqaVmXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
