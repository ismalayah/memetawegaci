Sometimes it works to show their lips moving (it certainly did in "<a href=#>Babe</a>"), but in "Good Boy!" the jaw movements are so mechanical it doesn't look like speech, it looks like a film loop. Look at "Babe" again and you'll appreciate the superior way in which the head movements and body language of the animals supplement their speech.</p><p>But speech is not the real problem with "Good Boy!" What they talk about is. The movie asks us to consider a race of superior beings who are built a few feet off the ground, lack opposable thumbs and walk around nude all the time. Compared to them, the aliens in "<a href=#>Signs</a>" are a model of plausibility. The dogs live within a few blocks of one another in Vancouver, and we meet their owners. I kept hoping maybe <a href=#>Jim Belushi</a> had moved to the neighborhood with Jerry Lee, from "<a href=#>K-9</a>," or that I'd spot <a href=#>Jack Nicholson</a> walking Jill. (Jack and Jill: I just got it.) But no. The humans are along the lines of <a href=#>Kevin Nealon</a> and <a href=#>Molly Shannon</a>, as Owen's parents. The dogs are voiced by <a href=#>Matthew Broderick</a> (as Hubble), Brittany Moldowan, <a href=#>Brittany Murphy</a>, <a href=#>Donald Faison</a>, <a href=#>Carl Reiner</a> and Delta Burke. Voicing one of the dogs in this movie is the career move of people who like to keep working no matter what. At least when you do the voice of an animated animal, they make it look a little like you, and your character can be the star. But when you voice a real dog, do you have to stand around all day between shots talking to the trainer about what a good dog it is?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46gpqicXZe8unmRaWds</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
