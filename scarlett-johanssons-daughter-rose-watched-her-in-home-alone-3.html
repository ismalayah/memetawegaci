“I guess it wasn’t intentional,” the Black Widow star, 36, told Seth Meyers on Monday, July 12. “We went through the series. We did Indiana Jones. Then we watched Back to the Future. And then, of course, naturally we did Home Alone. And I happened to be in the third Home Alone movie, and so I didn’t say anything to her because I thought she would make a big deal out of it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And I happened to be in the third Home Alone movie, and so I didn’t say anything to her because I thought she would make a big deal out of it.”</p><p>Rose, 6, “didn’t pick up on” her mom’s role “right away,” the actress explained during the Late Night With Seth Meyers appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scarlett-Johansson-Shares-Daughter-Rose-Reaction-to-Watching-Her-in-Home-Alone-3.jpg><p>“I had to really, like, [say], ‘See who that is?’” the Golden Globe nominee said. “She’s like, ‘Whatever. Is that you?’ I was like, ‘It’s me, your momma.’ And she was like, ‘Oh, OK. Whatever.’”</p><p>Johansson joked that the plot of the film was a “little thin,” saying sarcastically, “They often say that the third of every installment is the best one.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scarlett-Johansson-Home-Alone-3.jpg><p>The Tony winner shares Rose with her ex-husband <strong>Romain Dauriac</strong>. Four months after <a href=#>their baby girl’s August 2014 birth</a>, the new mom told <a href=#><strong>Barbara Walters</strong></a> that the role was “unbelievable” and “very overwhelming.”</p><p>The Oscar nominee has had a “hard” time deciding how much of her daughter’s life to share with the public. “On the one hand, you don’t want to isolate your kids, but you don’t want to make your kids feel like freaks,” the New York native told Parade magazine the following year. “There’s this fascination with famous kids, like they’re celebrity spawn.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Scarlett-Johansson-Shares-Daughter-Rose-Reaction-to-Watching-Her-in-Home-Alone-3-Seth-Meyers.jpg><p>Following her <a href=#>split</a> from the journalist, 39, in 2016, Johansson moved on with<a href=#><strong> Colin Jost</strong></a>. She and the<a href=#> Saturday Night Live </a>star, also 39,<a href=#> got married</a> in October 2020.</p><p>The comedian has a special relationship with Rose, a source exclusively told Us Weekly ahead of the couple’s nuptials.</p><p>“Colin is a great father figure for Rose,” the insider explained in November 2019. “He loves playing with her and<a href=#> she is obsessed with him</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Rose is also a big fan of her mom, and <a href=#>Johansson hilariously called her daughter her “shadow”</a> earlier this month.</p><p>“I’m sure in a few years she’s not going to want anything to do with me. So I should soak it all up,” the Avengers star told<a href=#><strong> Kelly Clarkson</strong></a>. “There’s definitely times where she’s on the other side of the bathroom door and I’m like, ‘Rose, you’ve gotta give me a minute!’ But she means well, and I’d rather have it that way than her wanting nothing to do with me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasm5GnuabA02ahqKCRo8C0u82sZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZqmoq5VixKLAwqGcnWWYmr9utc1mn6illWKurbvNnmRsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
