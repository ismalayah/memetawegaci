The incident turned Nezuko into a powerful demon, thus making her a threat to humanity. Nezuko’s transformation&nbsp;into a demon is the key plot element of&nbsp;Demon Slayer, and her transformation back to her human form is the end goal of the series’ protagonist Tanjiro Kamado. But does he succeed?</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>The Demon Slayers anime fans might still be scratching their heads on the question as it is still <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">awaiting a fourth season</a>. The anime has only reached the Swordsmith village arc and is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to adapt the last two arcs: the Hashira Training arc and the Final Battle arc</a>. But the good news is, the manga has already ended on May 18, 2023, after 205 chapters, and it makes clear the fate of its characters. So, does Nezuko survive the Final Battle?</p><h2 id=h-nezuko-s-story-in-demon-slayer data-injectable=false>Nezuko’s story in Demon Slayer</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>After the night of Muzan’s attack when Nezuko was found injured by Tanjiro, a Demon Slayer called Giyu Tomioka arrives at the scene and tells Tanjiro that he has to kill his sister since she had been turned into a demon. Since then, Tanjiro made it his goal to keep her from becoming an evil monster and turn her back to a human to prevent Nezuko from being slain by the demon slayers.</p><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true>Giyu helped Tanjiro become a powerful demon slayer while also conditioning Nezuko to view humans as her allies and Demons as her adversaries. As a result, Nezuko, despite being a powerful Demon with unique&nbsp;Blood Demon Arts, is not like other Demons and has extraordinary control over her need for human flesh. This allowed Nezuko to accompany and help her brother and other Demon Slayers in their battles against Demons.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://youtu.be/wvNHDkKtgfc?si=DloYhv5O_P78Oq0b</figure><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=882 data-injectable=true>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Demon Slayer season 3</a>, which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adapts the Swordsmith Village arc</a>, we find how Nezuko is distinct and more powerful than other Demons as she survives standing directly under the sun, which even a formidable Demon like Muzan was unable to do. This earned her the title of “chosen demon” from the Demon King. Nezuko aided Tanjiro significantly in defeating Gyokko, the&nbsp;Upper-Rank Six, as well as&nbsp;Hantengu, the Upper-Rank Four. However, whether or not she is able to turn back to a human defines her ultimate fate in the series, which is answered in the Final Battle arc.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happens to Nezuko at the end of Demon Slayer?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=803 data-injectable=true>Anyone who watched the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first season’s Asakusa arc (episodes 8–10</a>) will recall that Lady Tamayo made a promise to Tanjiro that if he allowed her access to his sister’s blood as well as the blood of strong demons like the Twelve Kizuki and Muzan, she would be able to find a means to transform Nezuko back into a human. Fortunately, Tamayo is indeed able to heal Nezuko, and during the first sub-arc of the Final Battle, known as the Infinity Castle arc, Nezuko transforms back into a human.</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>In the Infinity Castle arc, Sakonji Urokodaki is seen caring for Nezuko in the Butterfly estate after administering Tamayo’s medicine to her. After waking up from a long sleep, Nezuko flees outside and leaps off a cliff while Sakonji chases her. However, she lands safely and sprints over to where Muzan and Tanjiro are squaring up. Sakonji concludes from this that the medication was ineffective because she survived the fall unhurt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nezuko-as-a-human.jpg><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=814 data-injectable=true>But in a redefining moment, when Nezuko reaches the edge of the town. something unexpected happens. One of her eyes appears to have returned to normal, suggesting that the medication is indeed working—albeit slowly. She eventually remembers her time as a Demon as she collapses to the ground and sobs after a barrage of memories floods her head. Finally, slowly resuming her human shape, she stands back up and her hand changes back into a human hand as she declares that<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> she has become Nezuko Kamado once again</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Does Nezuko die at the end?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=false>Demon Slayer comes to a close with chapter 205 of the manga, showcasing a significant time shift that moved the series’ universe <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three generations ahead to present-day Tokyo</a>. Despite the final chapter’s suggestion that every member of the original cast has passed away and been reincarnated in contemporary Tokyo, you can relax knowing that Nezuko passes away of old age after returning to her human form. This indicates that Tanjiro will succeed in his goal and reunite with her younger sister.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWSxsLHSZqWesqWgvG6wyJ5koqZdmbKuu81mqqWZqZq%2FbrTEq2SsrJ%2Bnxm6x16mjmqGemrFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
