Clemont tried to befriend it, only for Chespin to stab his hand with its spikes and run off with several macarons in its hands. Later, it witnessed <a href=# title="Professor Sycamore (anime)">Professor Sycamore</a> being captured by <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> and helped Ash and Clemont track the kidnappers by following a trail of macaron pieces left by <a href=# title="Clemont's Dedenne">Dedenne</a>. Once there, Chespin attempted to steal the macarons <a href=# title=Jessie>Jessie</a> left lying around, only to fail and alert Team Rocket to Ash and Clemont's presence.</p><p>After Team Rocket unleashed their <a href=# title="Team Rocket's mechas">Mega Mega Meowth</a>, Chespin was saved from being crushed by the mecha by Clemont, which caused the two to bond a little. Chespin helped Clemont stop the rampaging machine by pulling out its plug, only for Team Rocket to use an alternate power source to continue fighting. Having no choice, Clemont and Chespin battled the mecha, only for Chespin's attacks to fail. Even when teamed up with <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu">Pikachu</a>, the mecha suffered no damage. However, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Blaziken Mask">Blaziken Mask</a>'s <a href=# title="Blaziken (Pokémon)">Blaziken</a> saved the day by weakening the machine with <a href=# title="Flamethrower (move)">Flamethrower</a>, allowing Chespin and Pikachu to finish it off and send Team Rocket blasting off.

To work off some of the weight, he had Chespin battle <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Froakie">Froakie</a> and Dedenne, but it lost to both due to its weight. Later that night, Clemont made a machine to help Chespin, but Chespin walked off into the woods after smelling some cooked food. Chespin wandered into <a href=# title="Carrie (XY015)">Carrie</a>'s house and was taken in for the night. Much to its delight, there was plenty of food for it to eat. Later that day, it had a battle with <a href=# title=Wylie>Wylie</a>'s <a href=# title="Delphox (Pokémon)">Delphox</a>. Chespin barely avoided <a href=# title="Will-O-Wisp (move)">Will-O-Wisp</a> and was about to be hit by Flamethrower, but Clemont stepped in and blocked the attack. Clemont and Chespin then teamed up to battle Delphox, using its rounded shape to roll and dodge attacks until it lost weight. This allowed Chespin to move much more quickly and hit it with a <a href=# title="Tackle (move)">Tackle</a> and <a href=# title="Vine Whip (move)">Vine Whip</a>. However, Chespin was hit by a powerful Flamethrower, which led to the activation of its Ability, Overgrow. Chespin then hit Delphox with one more powerful Vine Whip. It was then about to be hit by Delphox's <a href=# title="Mystical Fire (move)">Mystical Fire</a>, but the battle was stopped due to Wylie experiencing pains in his waist.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY038>Forging Forest Friendships!</a></i>, Chespin was used in a <a href=# title="Double Battle">Double Battle</a> with <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Clemont's Bunnelby">Bunnelby</a> against <a href=# title="Ash's Hawlucha">Hawlucha</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Froakie">Froakie</a>. Due to an argument between Froakie and Hawlucha, Clemont's Pokémon had the upper hand, but Froakie used its speed to trick Chespin's Pin Missile into hitting Bunnelby, knocking it out. After this, Froakie and Hawlucha started to fight, ending the battle. Later, it was shown that Chespin had eaten all of Serena's <a href=# title="Poké Puff">Poké Puffs</a> when she tried to give them out.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/d/dd/Clemont_Chespin_and_Serena_Pancham.png/375px-Clemont_Chespin_and_Serena_Pancham.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Chespin's rivalry with Pancham<p>In <i><a href=# title=XY042>Battling Into the Hall of Fame!</a></i>, Chespin was used in a <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">Team Battle</a> along with Pikachu and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Serena's Fennekin">Fennekin</a> against <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Shauna's Bulbasaur">Shauna's Bulbasaur</a>, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Tierno's Squirtle">Tierno's Squirtle</a>, and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Trevor's Charmander">Trevor's Charmander</a>. Chespin and the others were disadvantaged due to their opponents' great teamwork. When Shauna's Bulbasaur fired a <a href=# title="Solar Beam (move)">Solar Beam</a> at Pikachu, Chespin used its Vine Whip to tilt Pikachu up, allowing Pikachu to defeat Charmander. Chespin then used Vine Whip to counter Squirtle's <a href=# title="Rapid Spin (move)">Rapid Spin</a>, while Pikachu defeated a defenseless Bulbasaur. Eventually, Pikachu defeated Squirtle, giving Ash, Serena, and Clemont the win.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY050>Pathways to Performance Partnering!</a></i>, after eating all of the Poké Puffs, Chespin had a continuous quarrel with <a href=# title="Serena's Pancham">Serena's Pancham</a>.

Later, a disguised Team Rocket appeared and managed to steal Pancham, Chespin, Fennekin, Smoochum, and Farfetch'd. While trapped inside of a ball, it and Pancham again quarreled, causing them to escape from the ball. However, Team Rocket quickly found them again and managed to injure Fennekin, Smoochum, and Farfetch'd, forcing Chespin and Pancham to work together. Eventually, they got reunited with their <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer">Trainers</a>, and together Chespin and Pancham defeated Team Rocket. Although it seemed the two finally understood each other, Chespin and Pancham quickly quarreled again after the battle.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY084>Adventures in Running Errands!</a></i>, the group arrived at a <a href=# title="Pokémon Center">Pokémon Center</a> to shelter from the rain. However, a leak in the roof caused the center's machinery to short-circuit. While Clemont was fixing the machine, he had Chespin and Bunnelby run an errand to buy a machine part. Chespin was given a purse with a letter on which the part's name was written. While heading towards the shop, a wild <a href=# title="Fearow (Pokémon)">Fearow</a> snatched the purse from the duo. The two eventually managed to get the purse back and escape from the Fearow. While continuing their errand, Chespin and Bunnelby got attacked by Team Rocket. They managed to hold their own against <a href=# title="James's Inkay">Inkay</a> and <a href=# title="Jessie's Gourgeist">Gourgeist</a>. When Gourgeist attacked with Shadow Ball, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Fletchinder">Fletchinder</a> arrived and blocked the attack with <a href=# title="Steel Wing (move)">Steel Wing</a>, followed by Ash and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Noibat">Noibat</a>. Despite being told to stand back, Chespin and Bunnelby continued to fight Team Rocket themselves and managed to blast them off. Chespin and Bunnelby finished their errand, giving Clemont the last part to fix the Pokémon Center's main system.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/35/Clemont_Chespin_searching_water.png/375px-Clemont_Chespin_searching_water.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Chespin using its vines to search for underground water<p>In <i><a href=# title=XY108>A Watershed Moment!</a></i>, Chespin walked across a barren land along with Clemont, trying to keep the tired <a href=# title="Gym Leader">Gym Leader</a> from collapsing before they came across <a href=# title=Robon>Robon</a>. As Chespin, along with the others, observed the robot planting seeds, they got surprised by a <a href=# title="Seed Bomb (move)">Seed Bomb</a> attack coming from an angry <a href=# title="Chesnaught (Pokémon)">Chesnaught</a> looming from a large rock before suddenly attacking them. Chespin attempted to go against its fully-evolved form but backed down just as quickly as the Chesnaught began chasing it around. After managing to get away, Chespin pointed out a rundown building to the group that once belonged to <a href=# title=Chapman>Chapman</a>. After assessing the situation, the others and Chespin decided to help out Robon and also managed to gain the trust of Chesnaught. While <a href=# title="Clemont's Luxray">Clemont's Luxray</a> used his X-Ray vision along with Ash's Noibat using <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:animal echolocation">echolocation</a> to locate a water source, Chespin used Vine Whip to help search underground too, also encouraging Chesnaught to mimic with its own Vine Whip. After a while, Chespin managed to find the source, only to be blocked by a large rock. As everyone tried to remove it, Team Rocket appeared captured them. After Chesnaught managed to break the remote control, thus freeing everyone, Chespin combined its <a href=# title="Pin Missile (move)">Pin Missile</a> along with the other Pokémon's attacks to send Team Rocket blasting off. After Robon was fixed and successfully destroyed the rock to let the water flow, Chespin bade farewell to Chesnaught as they headed out.</p><p>Clemont sent out Chespin and Bunnelby to fight <a href=# title="Team Flare">Team Flare</a> in <i><a href=# title=XY133>Coming Apart at the Dreams!</a></i>.

In <a href=# title=XY137>the next episode</a>, Chespin and the rest of Clemont's Pokémon received medals from Professor Sycamore for their heroic efforts against Team Flare.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=XY139>Facing the Needs of the Many!</a></i>, Chespin was sent out to battle Xerosic again alongside Ash's Greninja. After countering Crobat's <a href=# title="Air Slash (move)">Air Slash</a> with Pin Missile, it dodged Malamar's <a href=# title="Signal Beam (move)">Signal Beam</a> by having Greninja hurl it at their opponents, allowing it to hit Crobat with an extra powerful Tackle.

As a result, Chespin would keep the food for itself and refuse to give it back. When caught in the act, it is unrepentant unless coaxed. Sometimes, it would eat so much food that it would become heavy, as evidenced in <i><a href=# title=XY015>An Appetite for Battle!</a></i>.

Chespin tends to be the more vocal of the group and usually displays a very happy-go-lucky attitude. In <i><a href=# title=XY021>A PokéVision of Things to Come!</a></i>, Chespin was shown to enjoy the spotlight and is very confident on camera, unlike its Trainer. First shown in <i><a href=# title=XY036>Battles in the Sky!</a></i>, Chespin has occasionally come out of its Poké Ball for various reasons, such as battling, meeting new Pokémon, or wanting to do something.
