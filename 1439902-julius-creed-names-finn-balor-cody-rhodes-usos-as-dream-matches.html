“There’s so many names that come to mind,” Julius Creed said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Then you start looking at the Steiner Brothers, you start looking at World’s Greatest Tag Team, you start looking at Kurt Angle, you start looking at the guys thar are on the roster right now.</p><p>“I would love to go out there in all types of styles. Let me see Finn Balor in a singles match. When we got to NXT, he was the top guy, so I would love to see that. Let me see Cody Rhodes, let me see where I fall in line.”</p><h2 id=h-julius-creed-on-potentially-facing-the-usos>Julius Creed On Potentially Facing The Usos</h2><p>Julius Creed then discussed a potential match against The Usos, who parted ways in 2023. He noted that they could have a great match if The Usos reunited at some point.</p><p>“A story old as time is two brothers start finding success together, and instead of breaking apart, maybe the brothers that have broken apart want to come back to prove themselves,” he said. “Well right now, The Usos have been broken apart. Do they still have that chemistry? Have they lost a step? I can tell you we’re firing on all cylinders, and we’re only getting better. We’re on the rise, they’re on the fall.</p><p>“Can they come back together, can we get that matchup, can we get to see what it looks like to run it with the Usos at some point? Creed Brothers, Usos, that’s exciting. Can we run it with their brother, Solo? I would love to be out there with Solo. Let’s find out. I think styles make matchups, and I’m excited to get out there with anyone I could.”</p><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of WWE Royal Rumble as it airs on Saturday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNscHJoYmK3trjIrqpmm6KasqV5zZqknqtdm7avuoybmKWnomKwsLDYZqmhp5SawG7B0qiqZpmjYrGzscCmZKaZpJi1pr8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
