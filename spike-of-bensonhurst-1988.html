When he gets an unmistakable signal from the mob boss (<a href=#>Ernest Borgnine</a>) that he should leave the neighborhood right away, he goes to live in a nearby Puerto Rican neighborhood with Bandana (<a href=#>Rick Aviles</a>), a friend of his who is also a boxer. And there he falls in love with Bandana’s sister, the beautiful, raven-haired India (<a href=#>Talisa Soto</a>). This is the kind of guy that song was written about - the one where if he’s not with the one he loves, he loves the one he’s with.</p><p>The comedy in this movie is generated mostly out of broad racial stereotypes, and I know people who were offended by it; one person told me the film was nothing but an extended racist slur against Italians and Puerto Ricans. This is a hard call. I do not think the filmmakers or the actors had any racist intents. I think they were inspired more by the ethnic humor of TV sitcoms and movies like “Saturday Night Fever.” And because offense was not intended, perhaps none should be taken. When Bandana’s mother says she’s pleased to meet a kid with Mafia connections because it’s a way to move up in the world, is this racism? Or irony? Or sarcasm on her part? The fact that we have to guess makes it funny.</p><p>For a movie about a hero who gets both of his girlfriends pregnant, this is a chaste film. Spike never even kisses the beautiful India, although she has her lips parted in expectation at one moment, while we lean forward in our seats. When we learn she’s pregnant, we’re thunderstruck, because we’re still waiting for that first kiss. Soto, who plays India, is a famous model who photographs, let it be said, as the most beautiful woman in the movies since <a href=#>Daphne Zuniga</a>. She is gorgeous, but, alas, she cannot act.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sp6KjlWK8p3nBnqWsp56dwrO%2F02ZocnBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
