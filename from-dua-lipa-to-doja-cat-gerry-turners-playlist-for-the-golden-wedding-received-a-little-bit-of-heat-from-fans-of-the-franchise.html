I am PLEASED. #TheGoldenBachelor #GoldenBachelor”</p><p>“I’ve been Team Theresa since their first date at the diner. I’m so happy for her and Gerry. And I’m so excited to see their wedding! #GoldenBachelor”</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>With The Golden Wedding just hours away, fans of The Bachelor franchise seriously cannot contain their excitement, asking dozens and dozens of questions leading up to the one-of-a-kind function: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Which The Golden Bachelor contestants will attend The Golden Wedding</a>? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Who is officiating The Golden Wedding</a>? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Where is The Golden Wedding</a>?</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>On a much sillier note, after Turner teased an extremely interesting wedding playlist on social media — consisting of artists like Dua Lipa, Doja Cat, Taylor Swift, Latto, Pitbull, and more — The Golden Bachelor lovers are dying to know more about the tunes that will be played at The Golden Wedding. Keep scrolling to find out for yourself…</p><p data-characters=46 data-current-count=46 data-injectable=false><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/C0mV6jtr0Et/?hl=en</a></p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist themselves spilled the tea in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>, where reporter Kristen Baldwin criticized Turner for sharing a wedding playlist on social media that consisted of mostly current pop music with no classic hits.</p><p>Gerry<strong>:</strong> “I’m not sure I need to defend anything. That’s just my personal preferences for music. I was asked for a playlist to provide for the wedding, not the actual pieces that will be used in the wedding. Those things are very important, and Theresa’s appreciation of music is huge. It’s very important to her. She’ll be making those choices. My [list] is for when we go off and get crazy and have the adult beverages.”</p><p>Theresa<strong>:</strong> “I came up with my list. They said, ‘Come up with 20,’ and I came up with 120. Music is really important to me. I mean, it sets a mood, makes everybody happy or melancholy or sad or thoughtful. I spent a lot of time on the list.”</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>While Turner featured a wide variety of toe-tapping tunes on his playlist, the two lovebirds spilled which artists just need to make an appearance at the function. To the surprise of fans of The Bachelor franchise — as well as those involved in the party planning process — Turner requested Pink, while Nist requested Van Morrison.</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>Similarly, the soon-to-be newlyweds admitted that there is one song that they wanted banned from the playlist, which Turner described as the “I like big butts and I cannot lie” song. For the musical maestros out there, this song is the one and only “I Like Big Butts” by Sir Mix-a-Lot — we do not blame Turner and Nist from wanting that tune as far away from their big day as possible!</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, while we all anxiously await&nbsp;The Golden Wedding&nbsp;that is to come this evening — mostly to see which songs made it onto the playlist — to relive the engagement between Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist, you can stream the must-see finale of&nbsp;The Golden Bachelor&nbsp;now via Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ynvs6mZJ2tkWK5qrzAZquoZZSkt6J5wpqrZp%2BVp7%2B6edOuqaedoqh6sbjAsqOiq6Ris7C%2BjK2fnmWXpLmlsc1mrp6clJ67qHnRnpqeoaaasW6tjKWgraycmnqjtdNmpp9lmJqutXnFq6amZZaWu7R5zp9kraCVYrOzrc2cn6KrlWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
