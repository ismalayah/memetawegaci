Washington chimed in with his own story.</p><p>"You found my pinkie? Don't show it. It's not nice," he warned. A pic flashed up of Washington busting out the finger moves to a laughing Meryl Streep as a decidedly unimpressed Liev Schrieber looked on. Washington explained that he'd suffered digit damage so many times playing college football that his finger eventually became dislocated. "It's fine now," he said.
