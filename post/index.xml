Recommended Videos Playing a hardened soldier caught in the throes of a massive conspiracy, the actor attempted to showcase a different side of his onscreen persona, which didn’t exactly go to plan when the series could only muster a critical approval rating of 39 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, in addition to barely making a splash on the Nielsen streaming ratings.</description></item><item><title>Contracted: Phase II movie review (2015)</title><link>/contracted-phase-ii-2015.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/contracted-phase-ii-2015.html</guid><description>While "Contracted" is an intimate character study, "Contracted: Phase II" aimlessly follows multiple characters. But of the film's ensemble cast, milquetoast beta-male Riley (Matt Mercer) is the film's clear lead. In "Contracted," Riley was a frustrated "nice guy." Which is to say: Riley, a shallow, shy young man who won't take "No" for an answer, chases after Samantha, a sensitive, questioning young woman who warily identifies as a lesbian, until she gives into her disease's symptomatic sex-lust and has relations with Riley.</description></item><item><title>Divinity movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</title><link>/divinity-movie-review-2023.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/divinity-movie-review-2023.html</guid><description>“Divinity” has a good log-line: two twins (Jason Genoa and Moises Arias) crash into a dying Earth to stop a man named Jaxxon (Stephen Dorff)&amp;nbsp;from making an immortality potion named Divinity, that his father (Scott Bakula) had worked on before dying.

Recommended Videos The character first debuted in 2006’s Cars, a flick that soon spawned a franchise. A franchise that entirely follows anthropomorphized vehicles, which all by itself is a tall task. Add to that the long delay between each of its releases — five years between the first and second, and six between second and third — and the way its branching offerings compounded in the time between flicks, and the franchise’s prominence is all the more surprising.</description></item><item><title>Pol Granch- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Dating</title><link>/pol-granch.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/pol-granch.html</guid><description>Pol Granch is a Spanish singer, composer, and actor.
