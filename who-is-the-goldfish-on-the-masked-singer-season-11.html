Her dress is entirely made up of gills, while her skirt is made out of her fins. Two additional fins are also on her arms.” Needless to say, she is equally as stunning as she is talented…</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Given that her performance was posted to YouTube beforehand, fans of the franchise have already taken to TikTok to share their guesses as to who she could be, with @carpoolkyleoke — an expert Masked Singer and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Claim to Fame</a> decoder — getting a piece of all the action.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true><a title=@carpoolkyleoke href=#>@carpoolkyleoke</a><p>Do you know EXACTLY who this is?!
