Back in 2014,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;announced a second film was officially in the works, confirmed by the original studio, New Line Cinema. The outlet reported that the original filmmaker, Rawson Marshall Thurber, was attached to direct and that a new co-writer, Adam Sztykiel (Made of Honor, Due Date), had boarded the project after being hired by New Line.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>It was also reported that the four core cast members — Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Will Poulter, and Emma Roberts — were all expected to reprise their roles, but noted that no actor had officially signed on. At the time, The Hollywood Reporter called the sequel “a given” after its promising financial success, but things have gone quiet since then. To this day, almost ten years later, the planned second installment <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still has an IMDb page,</a> so is the sequel still in the works?</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Sadly, it seems that a&nbsp;We’re the Millers 2&nbsp;won’t happen after all. During the press tour for&nbsp;Murder Mystery 2&nbsp;earlier this year, Jennifer Aniston was asked about other potential follow-ups for her movies that didn’t come to fruition, to which she responded with&nbsp;We’re the Millers.</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>“There was talk about that,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aniston replied</a>. “But that one didn’t happen.”</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>When asked about why plans for a sequel were dropped, Aniston responded that she “couldn’t remember.” Perhaps in the future, however, these plans may come together after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8isZLCdopp6tbTEZqSipJyav7R5kWaqraGcoXqprc%2BpnKehnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
