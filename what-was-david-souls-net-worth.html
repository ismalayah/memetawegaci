It’s complicated</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>The state of his finances were a guessing game, even to the folks at Celebrity Net Worth, who pride themselves on their ability to divine the contents of the wallets of people from TV. They put Soul’s personal holdings at a suspiciously even $1 million, and they do it without citing sources, means of income, or specific pay rates for projects throughout the performer’s life.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>For Soul’s part, he spoke openly about the missed opportunities that cost him money. He publicly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recalled</a> having sold his 7.5% stake in the Starsky & Hutch franchise for roughly the equivalent of $100,000 in contemporary figures. This meant missing out on cash from the show’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2004 reboot</a>, as well as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gender-swapped television reimagining</a> that’s currently in the works.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>And while we don’t know what David Soul’s income was like in the years leading up to his death, we can presume that he had some expenses. The Magnum Force actor had been married five times, including a particularly acrimonious marriage to Patti Carnell Sherman. He was arrested in 1983 for beating her while she was pregnant with the couple’s child, and ordered to attend one of what would soon become multiple stints in rehab.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>His struggles with chemical dependency didn’t end there, either. A three-pack-a-day smoker until the last ten years of his life, he had to have a lung removed, underwent a voice-altering tracheostomy, and battled COPD until his death. These issues would have further whittled down the performer’s already slim options for accepting work late in life.</p><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=873 data-injectable=false>While Soul was a member of one of the last generations of actors to really benefit from the syndication of their work, major medical and legal problems in the face of an inability to find work will put a dent in anyone’s nest egg — even with the assistance that the expat received from Britain’s NHS, which he described as “just the best.” His finances were as chaotic as they were opaque. In short, concrete answers to the question “What was David Soul’s net worth” are hard to come by.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZq6aq12Zrre1w2aqqK2cqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
