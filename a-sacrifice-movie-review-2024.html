As part of his research, he is allowed to look in on the scene of a mysterious group suicide that he suspects may be connected to a local cult. There,&nbsp;he meets Nina (<a href=#>Sylvia Hoeks</a>), the cop in charge of the investigation. At the same time, his 16-year-old daughter, Mazzy (<a href=#>Sadie Sink</a>), arrives in Berlin to stay with him. While he tries to reestablish a relationship with her, complications exacerbate when he and Nina begin a romantic relationship.</p><p>Upon arriving, Mazzy meets Martin (<a href=#>Jonas Dassler</a>), a seemingly nice young man who helps her navigate the trains and&nbsp;wants to see her again. He says he is involved with an environmental NGO and invites her to a meeting with his group, where he introduces her to the group’s charismatic leader, Hilda (Sophie Roos). Although Mazzy sees Martin and the group as a friendly alternative to her strained relationship with her father, it becomes apparent she's fallen in with the very same cult her father has been looking for. What's more, said cult&nbsp;been making increasingly apocalyptic statements about society's disintegration and how “sacrifices” need to be made to make things right again.</p><p>Some interesting films have been made over the years dealing with cults and the insidious ways in which they work themselves into the minds of vulnerable people. (“<a href=#>Ticket to Heaven</a>” (1981), “Split Image” (1982), and “<a href=#>Faults</a>” (2014) come to mind.) Those films took the subject seriously without reducing it to a plot device. “A Sacrifice,” by comparison, never displays any interest in what drives people to fall into this way of thinking. Making her feature debut as writer-director, <a href=#>Jordan Scott</a> handles the material (adapted from the 2015 novel Tokyo&nbsp;by <a href=#>Nicholas Hogg</a>) in a slickly impersonal manner, and the performances by the undeniably talented cast are equally meh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46aZKyZk6e2p7XCnmSmp6aesm6%2BxK%2Bgnq9dZ31zgA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
